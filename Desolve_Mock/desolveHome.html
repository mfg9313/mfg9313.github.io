								<tr><td><p>So what is Desolve? The short answer is that it comes from the 
										combination of <b>design</b> and <b>evolve</b>, something we hope we're doing 
											constantly. A slightly longer version is that we're a collection of 
												photographers, designers, and creatives who enjoy urban 
													photography. During our travels around the country, we take time 
														to document the cities we love. You'll also occasionally find 
															articles on design, our thoughts on the latest trends, and 
																the odd posting on photography.</p></td></tr>
																
																
									<!--Header of Second Paragraph and Verbiage--->
									<tr><th>So... what aren't we?</th></tr>
									
									<tr><td>Professional photographers, for one. Please keep in mind that
										 we're strictly amateur photographers. We submit these galleries out 
										 	of love and creative expression. We're not likely to remember the 
										 		settings we took the picture at, or even what lens we had. We're 
										 			also not very exclusive. If you like what you see here, and want
										 				 to participate, we'd love to have you. All galleries, 
										 				 	articles, and posts go through a submittal and approval 
										 				 		process, so if you're interested, drop us a line and tell 
										 				 			us what you have in mind.<br /><br />We also occasionally 
										 				 				have meetups. If, for example, we know we're coming to 
										 				 					Miami, we'll let everyone know and schedule a meet 
										 				 						up day to tour the city and take photos. If you'd 
										 				 							like us to visit your city,
										 				 								<a href = ""> let us know!</a>

							<h4>Photographers rights</h4> 
								<p>Due to the heightened security concerns around the country, it has 
									become common to find photographers routinely challenged when taking 
										photographs in public places. With that in mind, we invite you to join 
											us in a free forum as noted photographer Shea Hansen presents 
												"Photographer's Rights in a Post 9/11 World."<br /><br />
													Shea will discuss what your rights are when taking photos in a 
														public space. Following her talk we'll have an open forum where 
															you can ask questions, compare experiences, and become better 
																informed as to what your responsibilities are as amateur 
																	photographers.<br /><br />
																	The forum will be held at the Cheek-Chastain Gallery, 
																		227 West 29th Street in Manhattan on March 19th as part 
																			of their "Engage" lecture series Archived Galleries</p>
