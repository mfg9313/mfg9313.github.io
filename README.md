Before I go into a short description of the projects I would like to say that I don't own the images or designs for these projects, with exception to the Capstone design.

The following are only a few projects that where completed during my time attending the at the Palm Beach Code School, Oct 2015 to Feb 2016.


PBSC Mock: based on a older PBCS design, this only has a few pages from the site, demonstrating my undertanding of HTML & CSS.

Desolve: based on a photography site, this only has a few pages from the site, demonstrating my undertanding of HTML & CSS. 

Landon Hotel: based on a hotel website, demonstrating my undertanding of HTML, CSS, & Javascript.

Angular JS: based on a payment plan page, demonstrating my undertanding of HTML, CSS, & Angular JS.

Capstone: based on a technology news site, more information listed below.

The Capstone was created from scratch by myself. The main guidelines were the project must contain at least: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, PHP, MySQL, and have a Database connection.
Due to the Capstone not having the database connection anymore, the PHP pages are not currently running.
